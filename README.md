# DefSpaceShiny

This is a webtool for identifying whether a sequence is from the cis or trans defensin superfamily, and finding its location in a quantitative map of sequence space ([DefSpace webpage](https://ts404.shinyapps.io/DefSpace)).

It accompanies the following publication:

>Shafee, T.; Anderson, M. (2018) [A quantitative map of protein sequence space for the cis-defensin superfamily](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty697/5068591). _Bioinformatics_. doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty697
