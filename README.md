# DefSpaceShiny

This is a webtool for identifying whether a sequence is from the cis or trans defensin superfamily, and finding its location in a quantitative map of sequence space.

To use the tool online, please go to the [DefSpace webpage](https://ts404.shinyapps.io/DefSpace)

This tool is implemented as an online-compatible shinyR application using RGLwidget. For the version that runs locally in Rstudio, and allows interactive querying, see [this repo](https://github.com/TS404/DefSpace).
